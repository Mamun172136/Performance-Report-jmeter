Test Plan Summary
Scenario 1 (900 Requests): Average response time of 1474.21 ms, with throughput of 156.06 requests/sec; response times increase at higher percentiles.
Scenario 2 (300 Requests): Average response time of 1043.68 ms, throughput of 69.93 requests/sec; moderate response time, but still high at 90th and 95th percentiles.
Scenario 3 (1500 Requests): Average response time of 5316.11 ms, throughput of 48.26 requests/sec; significant performance degradation, with max response time reaching 29 seconds.
Recommendations
System performance degrades under higher loads, suggesting potential bottlenecks in server resources or database performance. Further optimization and scaling strategies are necessary to handle increased traffic efficiently.
